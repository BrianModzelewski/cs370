Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I used reinforcement learning and neural networks to create an intelligent agent that could traverse a maze and discover the prize. I was given a simple labyrinth structure, some utility functions, and a few unfinished functions for implementing the Q-learning algorithm. Implementing the main Q-training method, where I filled in the pseudocode section to produce episodes, decide actions (by exploration or exploitation), and train the model using experience replay. Improving the neural network model to improve the learning process and get better maze navigation outcomes.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists use computational ways to address complicated issues. To make sense of data, automate operations, and produce effective solutions, they employ algorithms, data structures, and diverse approaches like as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Computer science is about utilizing computing power to generate effective answers to real-world issues, not merely code.


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I begin by analyzing the problem to determine its nature and needs. I divide the problem into smaller, more manageable chunks. To address each component, I create algorithms or use current approaches. I am always testing and refining my solutions to guarantee that they are effective and efficient. In this course, I used the technique described above to handle the pirate intelligent agent issue, where understanding the problem was critical before diving into code.


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Being in the field of computer science has ethical obligations. As a computer scientist, I feel I owe transparency, privacy, and a guarantee that my solutions will not injure or mislead. For example, while developing AI models, it is critical to verify that they are objective and fair. To the Organization: I owe diligence, honesty, and a dedication to provide effective solutions while maintaining integrity and security. The duty in this project was to verify that the intelligent agent genuinely learns to navigate the maze without the use of hardcoded answers or unethical shortcuts. This course's lessons, together with my work on the pirate intelligent agent project, have strengthened my grasp of reinforcement learning and neural networks. As I progress, I plan to use these talents to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges in AI and computer science.
